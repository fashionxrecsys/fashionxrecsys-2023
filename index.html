                <h2>Fifth Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion</h2>
                <p>
                    on September 18th at 2pm Singapore time
                    <br> Held at the 17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, 18th-22nd September 2023, Singapore
                    <br> Workshop <u><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="#contact" >contact</a></font></u>
                    <br> <u><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href="#topics" >Submissions</a></font></u> accepted until <b>August 3rd AoE</b>
                    <li></li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade,
                    making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without
                    the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout.
                    However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.
                    For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment
                    and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of
                    satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable
                    them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in
                    fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very
                    interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways.
                    Recommender Systems are often used to solve different complex problems in this domain, such as
                    social fashion-aware recommendations (outfits inspired by influencers), product recommendations
                    or size and fit recommendations. The fifth edition of this workshop aims at providing an avenue
                    for continuing the discussion of novel approaches and applications of recommendation systems
                    in fashion and e-commerce with a particular focus on pandemic and post-pandemic era events
                    and their short and long lasting effects on e-commerce and Fashion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion,
                    recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas.
                    This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails.
                    Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion
                    and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a space for
                    collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems.
                    To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field,
                    we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive
                    participation formats.

                        The peer review process is double-blind (i.e. anonymised). This means that all submissions must not
                        include information identifying the authors or their organisation. Specifically, do not include the
                        authors’ names and affiliations, refer to your previous work in the third person and avoid providing any
                        other information that would allow to identify the authors, such as acknowledgments and funding.
                        However, it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that
                        provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors
                        are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization.
