            <h2>Fourth Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion</h2>
            <p>16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,
                <br> Seattle, WA, USA, 18th-23rd September 2022</p>

            <p>Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade,
                making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without
                the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout.
                However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.
                For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment
                and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of
                satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable
                them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in
                fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very
                interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways.
                Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for Recommender Systems and
                Machine Learning research communities.
            </p>

            <p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion,
                recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas.
                This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails.
                Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion
                and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for
                collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems.
                To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field,
                we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive
                participation formats.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically via <a
                        href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=fashionxrecsys2022#">EasyChair</a></li>
                <li> Submissions should be prepared according to the a <a href="https://recsys.acm.org/recsys22/call/">
                    single-column ACM RecSys format</a>. Long papers should report on substantial contributions of
                    lasting value. The maximum length is 14 pages (excluding references) in the new single-column
                    format. For short papers, the maximum length is 7 pages (excluding references) in the new
                    single-column format.
                </li>

                <li>The peer review process is double-blind (i.e. anonymised). This means that all submissions must not
                    include information identifying the authors or their organisation.
                    Specifically, do not include the authors’ names and affiliations,
                    anonymise citations to your previous work and avoid providing any other information that would allow
                    to identify the authors, such as acknowledgments and funding.
                    However, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations
                    that provided datasets,
                    hosted experiments or deployed solutions, if specifically necessary for understanding the work
                    described in the paper.
                </li>

                <li>Submitted work should be original. However, technical reports or ArXiv disclosure prior to or
                    simultaneous with the workshop submission, is allowed, provided they are not peer-reviewed. The
                    organizers also encourage authors to make their code and datasets publicly available.
                </li>

                <li>Accepted contributions are given either an oral or poster presentation slot at the workshop. At
                    least one author of every accepted contribution must be registered and attend the workshop to
                    present their work, either in-person or virtually. Please contact the workshop organization if none
                    of the authors will be able to attend.
                </li>

                <li>All accepted papers will be available through the program website. <u>Moreover, we are currently in
                    conversations with Springer in order to publish the workshop papers in a special issue journal.</u>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Additional Submission Instructions for Demos </h3>

            <p> Submissions for extended abstract of demos should be prepared according to the standard double-column
                ACM SIG proceedings format as described in the <a
                        href="https://recsys.acm.org/recsys22/call/#content-tab-1-5-tab">RecSys 2021 Demos Call for

            <ul>
                <li>An overview of the algorithm or system that is the core of the demo, including citations to any
                    publications that support the work..
                </li>
                <li>A discussion of the purpose and the novelty of the demo.</li>
                <li>A link to a narrated screen capture of your system in action, ideally a video. The maximum duration
                    of screen capture is 10 minutes. (This section will be removed for the camera-ready version of
                    accepted contributions but might be included in the virtual platform used to host the online part of
                    the workshop.)
