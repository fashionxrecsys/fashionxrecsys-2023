            <h2>Fourth Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion</h2>
            <p>17th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,
                <br> Singapore, 18th-22nd September 2023</p>

            <p>Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade,
                making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without
                the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout.
                However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.
                For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment
                and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of
                satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable
                them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in
                fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very
                interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways.
                Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for Recommender Systems and
                Machine Learning research communities.
            </p>

            <p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion,
                recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas.
                This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails.
                Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion
                and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for
                collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems.
                To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field,
                we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive
                participation formats.</p>

                    Specifically, do not include the authors’ names and affiliations,
                    anonymise citations to your previous work and avoid providing any other information that would allow
                    to identify the authors, such as acknowledgments and funding.
                    However, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations
                    that provided datasets,

                </li>

                <li>Submitted work should be original. However, technical reports or ArXiv disclosure prior to or
                    simultaneous with the workshop submission, is allowed, provided they are not peer-reviewed. The
                    organizers also encourage authors to make their code and datasets publicly available.
                </li>

                <li>Accepted contributions are given either an oral or poster presentation slot at the workshop. At
